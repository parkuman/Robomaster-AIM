    "An artificial neural network is a system of 'neurons' that are actually mathematical functions. These functions can take multiple inputs and produce one or multiple outputs. For each input to the neuron there is also an associated 'Weight vector', this number is what makes each neuron unique. The function of each neuron can be considered as a linear combination of weights and inputs with a bias. The weights of each connecting neuron can be thought of as the strength of that connection, or how much the former neuron affects the neuron in question. The bias of a specific neuron is a numerical value of how active that neuron tends to be within the net as a whole. After summing the products of each weight and input as well as the bias, a nonlinear function (the activation function) is applied. Most commonly the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU). If the number produced by the reLU is above 0, then that number is used without adjustment, howver if the number produced is less than zero, then the number used will be 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "The network itself can be broken down into specific sections. The input layer, the 'black box', and an output layer. The input layer is intuitively the first layer of neurons that are activated by the subject. For example in a 500 by 500 pixel picture of a handwritten number, each pixel might correspond to a neuron, and the degree to which said pixel is 'coloured in' by the number is the initial value. The 'black box' is the middle section of neuron layers where the magic happens. The connections the neurons make between layers will adjust with training such that when the 'signal' gets to the output layer, it is correct. \n",
    "\n",
    "Training the data was briefly mentioned above, so how eactly does this happen? Well first we must define a cost function for the neural net. This will tell the computer what the output was supposed to be as opposed to what it produced. The average cost of all the training data available is a measure of how well the neural net performs its job. Since we want to minimize the value of the cost function, we need to use the negative gradient of the function. \n"
